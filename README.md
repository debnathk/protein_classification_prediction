**Protein Family Classification from Raw Protein Sequences using Naïve Bayes**

•  Labelled **Structural Protein Sequence** dataset containing **346,325 ‘string’ type** datapoints were imported from Kaggle, followed by pre-processing

•  **Feature extraction** from the raw string data were performed using **CountVectorizor**

•  **Naïve Bayes classifier** were utilized for the prediction from the count vectorized features, followed by **AdaBoost classifier for comparison**

•  **Accuracy** achieved in the task of classification was **76.38%**
